				Assignment 1
Part(a)
For the first part of the assignment, our objective was to find the RGB representation of a true white object under three different illuminance.
As the object is truely white, its reflectance will be unity.
That is, 		𝜌(𝜆) = 1
Therefore,	𝐶(𝜆) = 𝐼(𝜆)𝜌(𝜆)
becomes		𝐶(𝜆) = 𝐼(𝜆)

Now starting with philips_spectra, I one by one calculated the tristumulus values X, Y and Z, put them in an array and multiplied with inverse of the matrix that is used for the conversion between RGB and XYZ model. Consequently, I got an array that contains normalized values of RGB color components. This array is as follows,
		[0.44552062, 0.19951144, 0.0603651 ]
When multiplied with 255, I got the the following values for red, green and blue component,
		Red = 113.60775919058099
		Green = 50.8754179227766
		Blue = 15.393100008143158
This combination corresponds to sepia color.


When I repeated the same procedure for the silvania_spectra, I got the following normalized values for RGB components that are reflected back from a true white object,
		[0.68675213, 0.39204896, 0.13036428]
When multiplied with 255, I got the the following values for red, green and blue component,
		Red = 175.12179229596404
		Green = 99.9724847224213
		Blue = 33.24289207793977
This combination corresponds to light brown color.


For the uniform_spectra, the normalized color component values are as follows,
		[1.00000032, 0.99999973, 1.0000001 ]
The normalized values shouldn't be greater than 1 but somehow because of some value in the data, it's exceeding by very small amount. So to be on safe side, I rounded-off the RGB values and they are as follows,
		Red = 255.0
		Green = 255.0
		Blue = 255.0
This combination corresponds to pure white color.



Part(b)
In the 2nd part of this assignment, we need to find the RGB representation of an object, the reflectance of which is 
		𝜌(𝜆) = w(𝜆)/max(w(𝜆))
In this case, we have to consider uniform_spectra.
So, I first calculated the radiance for each x, y and z by using the following formula,
		C(𝜆) = uniform_spectra*𝜌(𝜆)
Then, to find the respective tristumulus values,
		X = sum(C(𝜆)*x(𝜆))
		Y = sum(C(𝜆)*y(𝜆))
		Z = sum(C(𝜆)*z(𝜆))

I got,		X = 0.63402499
		Y = 0.72249052
		Z = 0.7367702

By multiplying the array of X, Y and Z with the inverse of the matrix that is used for the conversion between XYZ and RGB color models, we get the normalized values of RGB colors reflected from given object,
		[0.50663127, 0.76931411, 0.73644147]
When multiplied with 255, we get values of colors in 8 bit format,
		Red = 129.19097505347645
		Green = 196.1750971840394
		Blue = 187.79257556388146
This combination corresponds to pearl aqua color.
