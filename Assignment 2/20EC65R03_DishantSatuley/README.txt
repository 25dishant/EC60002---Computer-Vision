To run the code, first upload all the images supplied with the assignment to the google drive and take utmost care of the file path . 

Open '20EC65R03_DishantSatuley_CV.ipynb'  file using google colab and mount the drive by running the first section of the code.

Paths are hard coded in the '20EC65R03_DishantSatuley_CV.ipynb' file so please check them if an error occurs.

When you run the code, a csv file is generated in google drive.
Observations can be made using that csv file.

If you run the code again, values in csv file may vary for the first case as the value of p is being generated randomly.
